test case 1: Normal case 
	Putting 120 Km into the Km bar then get the outputs which is the  open_time and close_time 
	After you push the "submit"button
	You will get the webpage doesn't have change, but the km, miles, open_time and close_time， begin_date,begin_time send to the database, and you can check it from the JavaScrip Console  
	After you push the "Display" button 
	You will open a new tab and it shows "a new page" with a table with all values you just enter in the page

test case 2: special case
	when you enter 0 for the Km, it will shows you the corresponding open and close will the begin_time and begin_date
	when you push " submit" all values of 0 km will get into the database 
	when you push the " Display" it will show you the values in the database 

test case3:
	when any of those  km, miles, open_time and close_time， begin_date,begin_time is 0, when you push “submit” “display” button, nothing will display 




PLEASE READ THIS:
I use the db.tododb.delete_many({}) to clear the database, but sometimes I found the new page with data will come out, it maybe in the next page, I am wonder why 

And from my test, I found that db.tododb.drop() will cause the error.
